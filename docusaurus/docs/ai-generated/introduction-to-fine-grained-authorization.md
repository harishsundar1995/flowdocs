# Introduction to Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)

Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA) is an advanced access control model that allows you to define very specific and detailed permissions for users and resources in your application.

## Key Concepts

FGA is built around the concept of relationships between users, objects, and permissions. Permissions are stored as tuples that define the relationship between subjects, objects, and relations.

## Benefits

- Granular Control at the individual resource level
- Scalability for complex permission structures
- Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements
- Clear auditability of access permissions

## Common Use Cases

FGA is commonly used in document sharing systems, multi-tenant applications, collaborative platforms, and healthcare systems where precise access control is essential.

## Getting Started

To implement FGA, you'll need to define your authorization model, create relationship tuples, check permissions before access, and update relationships as needed.
