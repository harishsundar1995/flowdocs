# Understanding Model Context Protocol

## Introduction

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI applications to connect with data sources and tools. It provides a unified way for AI models to access external context.

## Core Components

MCP consists of three main components:

**Resources** - Data sources that AI can read from such as files, databases, and API responses.

**Tools** - Functions that AI can execute to perform actions like searches, data modifications, and API calls.

**Prompts** - Reusable templates that can be shared across applications.

## Architecture

MCP uses a client-server model with three layers:

- MCP Hosts: AI applications that need data access
- MCP Clients: Protocol clients managing server connections
- MCP Servers: Programs exposing capabilities

## Benefits

MCP offers standardized integration for developers, enhanced context for AI applications, and better results for users through access to real-time relevant information.

## Getting Started

To build an MCP server, define your capabilities, implement the protocol handlers, and deploy with proper authentication. To use an MCP server, configure the connection in your AI application and authorize access to capabilities.

## Use Cases

Common applications include development tools, business systems, personal productivity apps, and data source integrations.
