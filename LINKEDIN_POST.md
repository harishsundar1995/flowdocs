## Version 2: Technical & Detailed

🎉 Proud to announce: FlowDocs is now open source! 

After months of development, I'm releasing a system that bridges AI conversations and professional documentation.

🔍 The Problem:
Creating and maintaining documentation is time-consuming. What if we could just describe what we want and have it automatically formatted, published, and synced?

💡 The Solution:
FlowDocs connects Claude Desktop (via Model Context Protocol) → Strapi CMS → Docusaurus, creating a seamless pipeline from natural language to published docs.

🏗️ Architecture Highlights:
• MCP Server for LLM integration
• Strapi v5 headless CMS for content management
• Docusaurus v3 for beautiful documentation sites
• Real-time sync with hot-reload
• Complete CRUD operations via natural language

🎯 Use Cases:
• Technical documentation & API docs
• Internal knowledge bases
• Content publishing workflows
• Educational content creation

Built with TypeScript, Node.js, and modern best practices. Fully documented, with contribution guidelines and security policies.

🌟 Whether you're a developer, technical writer, or content creator, I'd love your feedback!

## Version 3: Story-Driven

💭 "I wish I could just talk to create documentation..."

That thought led me to build FlowDocs, and today I'm open-sourcing it! 🎉

🎨 The Vision:
Documentation shouldn't feel like a chore. As developers, we spend hours writing, formatting, and organizing docs when we could just explain what we need.

🔧 What I Built:
An end-to-end system where you literally have a conversation with Claude, and it creates, updates, and publishes documentation to a beautiful site - instantly.

The magic: Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Strapi CMS + Docusaurus

⚡ Real Example:
Me: "Create a guide on setting up authentication"
Claude: *Creates formatted doc, adds it to Strapi*
My site: *Updates automatically in 10 seconds*

No manual editing. No copy-pasting. Just conversation.

🌱 Why Open Source?
This kind of tooling should be accessible to everyone. Whether you're documenting an API, building a knowledge base, or creating educational content, you should be able to do it naturally.

🤝 I'm looking for:
• Early adopters to test and provide feedback
• Contributors interested in AI + content management
• Ideas for new use cases
